findings from exercise 3:

- file size: 10M
	- DBUF: 10  bytes   -> sys0m1.628s
	- DBUF: 100 bytes   -> sys0m0.184s
	- DBUF: 512 bytes   -> sys0m0.044s
- file size: 100M
	- DBUF: 10  bytes   -> sys0m16.628s
	- DBUF: 100 bytes   -> sys0m1.840s
	- DBUF: 512 bytes   -> sys0m0.468s      

with O_SYNC:

- file size: 10M
	- DBUF: 100 bytes   -> sys0m2.744s
	- DBUF: 512 bytes   -> sys0m0.496s

obviously with O_SYNC, total elapsed time of operations is much bigger.

it makes huge difference for speed, especially with small buffers.
